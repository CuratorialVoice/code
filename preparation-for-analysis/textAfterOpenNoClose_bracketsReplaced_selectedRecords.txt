Above is the magnificent river front of the Louvre, receding in perspective. Below is a dingy three-storied brick house, its side shored up and abutting on an empty space, enclosed by a ramshackle paling, and bordered by another shored-up house. In the top-floor windows are broken panes. In the roadway, in place of the carriages and pedestrians in front of the Louvre, is a man holding two horses which are apparently being broken in.

Great Sir, I am arrived from Albion's Court, Who have taken in Dudgeon what you may think Sport; So it may for the present; but we'll soon make it appear, You'll have reason to laugh the wrong side of your ear! Our Traders in Nootka, by some of your Curs, Were all sent to Quod and robb'd of their Furs Your right so to do which you claim from the Pope We Britons dont value the end of a rope! It's a farce you may make your weak Subjects believe, But our right's equal to yours from Adam and Eve. Therefore if you don't make us immediate amends No longer can we look upon you as Friends Should you wish for a War we have got a new race Of such brave fighting fellows, not the Devil dare face! A sample I've brought, only four of our men, Mendoza, Dick Humphries, Joe Ward, and Big Ben: So great is their power each Lad with one blow, Would knock down an Ox, or twelve Spaniards lay low, At home we can raise twelve hundred like these That would crush all your Troops as easy as fleas. For Centuries past England's rul'd o'er the main, And if it please Heavn'n hope to do so again.

At his feet is a book, Mayor of Garratt *BRACKETED* . Just behind him are Wood and Waithman *BRACKETED* . All the aldermen wear their gowns. Wood says: It can't be a Wood louse at all events; Waithman : —wait-man, what the devil could bring it here? Behind stands Cox *BRACKETED* with hair arranged to suggest small horns; he glares fiercely at the insect with folded arms, saying, How Kean it cocks it *BRACKETED* eye at me! The centre and largest figure is Curtis, inspecting the insect through a nautical telescope. Under his gown he wears a white waistcoat or jacket defining a vast paunch with striped sailor's trousers, cf. BM Satires 11353. A chain of sausages *BRACKETED* supports a bunch of crossed spoons, sauce-boat, and ladle which rests upon his paunch. At his side are carving-knife and fork. He says: It looks very like a Turtle, it might make very good soup—I hope there is more to be found speedy and soon *BRACKETED* , it's quite fat! Behind him John Key *BRACKETED* , younger and handsomer than the others, stands on a low stool, holding his sheriff's wand; he says : I'l find a Key for this mystery. His fellow sheriff, Heygate, says: Gang your Hey *BRACKETED* —gate its na Scotch, I'll warrant for it has na high cheek banes *BRACKETED* it must ha crawled out of some Garrett. Between the two sheriffs is the angry puckered profile of Sir Charles Flower; he holds a paper, City Bonds *BRACKETED* , and says: It must have droped out of some musty old Flower sack. Behind Heygate and touching his arm stands Sir James Shaw; he says: Pshaw, its a scotch louse I'l take my Oath of it. Inconspicuous on the extreme right is Sir Claudius Hunter, saying, It's a Nunter. All these heads are portraits. Two other heads are indicated only. Under the bed is a large chamber-pot with the City Arms inscribed: Presented by the Corporation to The Lady Mayoress.

A planter in a broad-brimmed hat reclines in an arm-chair, wearing top-boots; the left leg, horizontally extended, is held between the legs of a negro servant, who is supported by a second *BRACKETED* , while a mulatto boy steadies the back of the chair, and is supported by the back of a fourth boy *BRACKETED* . The man pushes his right foot against the posterior of the first negro, in order to draw off his left boot. *BRACKETED* One of the Luxuries. The planter leans back in a chair, while one woman cuts his hair, and a second, kneeling on the ground, washes his feet. They are near-white. A negro girl plies a fan, and a second approaches with a bowl on her head holding out a goblet.

The boat is The Piscator of Virginia; holding the tiller and seated astride it, facing the fishers, is a small plump boy in jacket and breeches with the butterfly wings of Cupid. Beside him is a flagstaff topped with cushion and two superimposed crowns; from it flies a large Union flag inscribed St George's Union. The tiller terminates in a small rampant lion. In the bows is a mast and sail below which are a big glass jar containing worms, and an open book: Broad Grins | Like some Fat Gentleman who Bobs for Eels. The boat is decorated with figures in relief: a frieze of fish, and plump naked figures. There is a realistic background of water and trees.

Bent He Seems. On Desperate revenge, which shall rebound upon his own rebellious head—Milton. O'Connell, a ferocious creature with cloven hooves, wearing a towering papal crown, advances against Erin and Britannia *BRACKETED* , menacing them with firebrand and blood-stained dagger. Shouting Down with the Heretick's, he leads a band of savage Irish peasants armed with pikes, &c, who rush forward surrounded by flames. O'Connell wears a barristers's gown and wig, the tails of which terminate in tiny serpents. Under his gown is a surplice on which is a large red cross with the letters MP. His goat-like legs are covered with black drapery, the upper part of which forms pouches for an arsenal of pistols and daggers; more daggers are thrust into a sash. Across his shoulder is a large net containing coins and labelled Rent *BRACKETED* . His firebrand is Discord; its flames terminating in dense smoke, are Persecution, Bigotry, Intolerance. On his left hand is a mailed and spiked gauntlet. He tramples on books and papers which lie among the flames: Protestant Ascendancy; Toleration Liberty of Conscience, and a large volume on which is the date 1701, implying that the Act of Settlement, establishing the Protestant Succession, has been overthrown. Erin is seated on clouds, one hand resting on her harp; she flinches back, saying, Vain and ambitious demagogue Thou art thy Countrys worst enemy. Britannia stands beside her wearing a helmet on which stands a British lion; she holds her shield and raises a large tilting-lance, exclaiming Peace. Monster, peace! go tell thy horrid tale To savages, and howl it out in deserts.

The Age of May 13th 1827—for above letter. The demon on his back, a scaly creature with wings, breathes fire and the words: Then lustily pull away Devils Keep up the ball | Never mind whats to pay, | The public pay's for all. Rum te bum bay! bum te bum te bay! Appropriate papers, &c, lie at the feet of the five principals: by John Bull: Address to the King; by the bishop and the King: Petitions *BRACKETED* and a crosier. The King puts his foot on the Pope's triple cross. By the latter are: Bulls, The Book of Martyrs, Bloodshed, Civil Wars, The Popes Curse, Vice, Plots, Preistcraft, Ignorance, Superstition. By Canning: Intrigue, Superstition, Spies, Torture, Corruption, Mother Hunn's Amours a little Reddish, The Life of an Actress, Infamy. Below the demon: Perdition. Behind the King and the two chief combatants soldiers are drawn up at attention with fixed bayonets; behind John Bull are the masts of ships. There are also three subsidiary scenes: *BRACKETED* The head of the Duke of York in profile to the right, ringed with clouds, looks down to say: Dear George, you must be decided and maintain with manly firmness the prerogative of the Crown, if the Pope puts his foot in your Dominions, the consequences, in the struggle for power, will be dreadful, Remember me—Adieu. *BRACKETED* In the upper right corner five of the resigning Ministers are grouped in clouds with a sixth, Liverpool, seated in a chair and covering his face with his hand. Wellington, in uniform, folds his arms, saying, I must be either more or less then man, if I could suffer my character to be villify'd in the manner it has been by the press without coming down to this house to explain my reasons for not joining the present Administration. The next is not characterized. The third is Eldon, incorrectly wearing a Garter ribbon and star; he says: I am persuaded, that if the Roman Catholic question is carried; there will be an end to the civil and religious liberties of the country, for Ecclesiastical tyrany, must produce civil tyranny. The fourth, in profile to the left, is Westmorland. Peel sits pen in hand against a pedestal inscribed Public Opinion; under his elbow is a large paper: Letter to the King on forming a No Popery Administration. At his feet are papers inscribed Mr Peel and The Prisoners Friend. Liverpool, on the extreme right, says: As I was always a True Protestant so I always advocated the cause of Peace. *BRACKETED* Four Jesuits dance hand in hand before three naked martyrs, one a woman, burning at the stake. They are presided over by a Grand Inquisitor, also a Jesuit, on a raised chair. Below: The Holy Inquisition at work *BRACKETED* .

A great pile of documents with a Holy Bible in the centre, is ready for the flames; Horne Tooke, in bonnet rouge, dressing-gown, and slippers, kneels at Burdett's feet, holding a dark lantern *BRACKETED* , and applying a flaming brand, inscribed Sedition, to the pile. Three simian and negroid creatures holding papers like sub-human newsboys, as in Gillray's New Morality *BRACKETED* , apply torches to the pile. One, with a tartan cloth round its waist, holds the Edinburgh Review, another the Morning Chronicle; the third wears a wig inscribed Independ *BRACKETED* Wig.

Beside Tooke crouches Bosville placing an Act against Fomenting Treason on the flames. Behind him Whitbread stands, dressed as a drayman, and holding a barrel on his shoulder whose contents he empties on to the fire.

In the foreground *BRACKETED* the Marquis of Buckingham and Lord Grenville, fat and gouty, hurry off to the right, bent double, their heavy posteriors exaggerated, their heads cut off by the right margin. They carry off large money-bags, that of the former, labelled Family Pickings, is £400000; the latter's is Exchequer Pickings *BRACKETED* . Buckingham says: come away! Brother-Broad-Bottom! *BRACKETED* come away. Grenville answers: Ay! they may want to Reform our Pockets perhaps.
