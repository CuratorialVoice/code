Pitt, seated in profile to the right, very thin, with his hair rising on his head in terror, says, "The blood of the Virtuous & Honorable ? then Lord have mercy upon Me!" Dundas, wearing a tartan plaid, adds, equally terrified, "And upon Me!" Fox says "Confusion! - one of Our daggers, by all thats bloody! how the devil did he come by that ? - ha! what's that ? Nineteen Assassins ? - O damnation! - we're found out & all our schemes ruin'd for ever!!!" Sheridan says: "O Charley, Charley! - farewell to all our hopes of Levelling Monarchs! - farewell to all our hopes of paying off my debts by a general Bankruptcy! - farewell to all hopes of plunder! - in a moment of Victory we're trap'd & undone!!!"  30 December 1792   Hand-coloured etching

While T-y W-y [Tylney Wellesley], (loyal Soul)   Will take its measure with a 'Pole';   And C-h [Castlereagh] will low beseech   To kiss a corner of the 'breech';   And next will come old G-y R-e [Georgy Rose]   And in the 'touch-hole' shove his nose!
