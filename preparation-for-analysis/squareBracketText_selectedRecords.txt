I had little Occasion to repeat the Advice, for he is a Man of Genius; and, like all such Men, is fair and human'. Dalrymple wrote to Gillray: 'I beg you will not impute what I am going to mention to any Breach of my promise not to interfere in any of the prints. But I confess I wish that the Gag was out of the Speaker's Mouth. It may hurt his feelings as a Gentleman . . .'  *BRACKETED* . B.M. Add. 27337, fo. 20. The gag was Dalrymple's idea]

[A disjointed snake had been designed by Franklin in 1754 for the 'Pennsylvania Gazette', and was frequently used in other colonial newspapers from ten to twenty years later, with the legend "unite or die". After the first Congress in 1774 this was superseded by a living snake encircling a tree or staff of Liberty which is supported by the arms of the twelve colonies represented at Philadelphia with the legend "united now alive and free . . ." This headed the 'New York Journal or the 'General Advertiser' of 15 Dec. 1774. Reproduction, Halsey, 'The Boston Port Bill', p. 125; see also pp. 3, 270.]

Run was disputed between the English and Dutch between 1620 and 1667. At the peace of 1634 Cromwell forced the Dutch to restore it; it was taken again in 1664 and kept at the peace of Breda. It changed hands, 1796-1814, being finally restored to the Dutch in 1814. "Sillebar" is obscure.]
